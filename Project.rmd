An example using leaflet for the coursera R Markdown and Leaflet assignment. Using the quakes dataset as it contains locational data and is included in R

```{r echo=FALSE}
warningIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "warning.ico",
  iconWidth = 40, iconHeight = 40
)

map <- leaflet(data = quakes[1:100,]) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(~long, 
                    ~lat, 
                   popup = ~as.character(mag), 
                   clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
                   icon = warningIcon)

map
